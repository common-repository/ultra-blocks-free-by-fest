## UltraBlocks Blocks List

### Standard Blocks

The following blocks already exist in Gutenberg, yet have been enhanced and improved with additional functionality. We thought that they lacked some features, so we went ahead and added those for you. To learn more about the full range of settings and customization options, please read [‘Block Settings & Customization.’](https://ultrablocks.festplugins.com/ultrablocks-help/#block-settings-and-customization)
